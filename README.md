# GPanoConverter
This simple WPF tool converts any photo into Google 360Â° Panorama (compatible with Google Cardboard).

It simply adds XMP metadata into the image and gives you a new copy that will be viewable in Google+, Android, Google Cardboard, or that can be submitted to Google Maps.
More about required XMP metadata you can read [here](https://developers.google.com/photo-sphere/metadata/).
No third-party libraries used - only pure WPF.
